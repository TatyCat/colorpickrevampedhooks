### Summary
This project was designed by me. I used React Hooks to manage state to practice working with React state in a responsive and user friendly way.   
ColorPick Revamped allows you to change the sliders to pick the color of your dreams. Click the HSLa text to _instantly_ copy the HSLa values to your clipboard.  When you have selected a color that you would like to keep, click the 'Store This Color' button to store the color below. Use the 'Give Me a Random Color' button to get a random color.

### Technologies Used 
React, 
Javscript, 
HTML, 
CSS
